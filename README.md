# BuildingGameAI
h1: Implemented arrive, wander and flocking behavior.

h2: Implemented A* and Dijakstra algorithms and test it with two graph. Designed an indoor game environment and implemented pathfinding algorithm by using A* and pathfollwing algorithm.

h3: Designed a game environment with a player and a monster. Implenmented a decision tree to control the player and a behavior tree to control the monster. Record some data from the running of the game, then implement learning decision tree by ID3 algorithm and use it to control the monster.
