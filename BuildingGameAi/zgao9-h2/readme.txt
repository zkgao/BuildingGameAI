generator is the c++ program I used to generate the second graph.
dj_firstgraph mean using the Dijkstra’s  algorithm to do the search on the first graph. It is used in Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* part.
dj_secondgraph mean using the Dijkstra’s  algorithm to do the search on the second graph. It is used in Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* part.
astr_firstgraph_firstheuristic mean using the astr algorithm and the first heuristic to do the search on the first graph. It is used in Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* part and the heuristic part.
astr_secondgraph_firstheuristic mean using the astr algorithm and the first heuristic to do the search on the second graph. It is used in Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* partand the heuristic part.
astr_firstgraph_secondheuristic mean using the astr algorithm and the first heuristic to do the search on the first graph. It is used in  heuristics part.
astr_secondgraph_secondheuristic mean using the astr algorithm and the first heuristic to do the search on the second graph. It is used in  heuristics part.
Finally, the together is for the last part.
